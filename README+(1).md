## General Information
- A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state. 
- In such an attempt, BoomBikes aspires to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation due to Covid-19. They have planned this to prepare themselves to cater to the people's needs once the situation gets better all around and stand out from other service providers and make huge profits.

## Conclusions
- Overall 2019 has more sales as compared to 2018
- In the end of 2019 sales started declining due to start of the pandemic
- Overall fall has more sales. One reason can be that fall has beautiful scenic view due to the lead shedding and people love to travel and see that
- Autocorrelation exists hence we can say that linear regression model is not a good idea
- Overall year, month and temparature have highest influence on the count of customers.
